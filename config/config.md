## We need to create two files

First file `default.json` with code:

```json
{
    "BOT_TOKEN": "Telegram token",
    "OPENAI_KEY": "OpenAI Key",
    "USERS_ID": "User IDs separated by commas without spaces"
}
```

Second file `production.json` with code:

```json
{
    "BOT_TOKEN": "Telegram token",
    "OPENAI_KEY": "OpenAI Key",
    "USERS_ID": "User IDs separated by commas without spaces"
}
```



Telegram token you can get in [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)

Secret API key from openai you can get in [API keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
